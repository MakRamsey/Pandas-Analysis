Greetings!


Please see this complete "Pandas-Challege" repository containing all relevant files for module 4 challenge submission. Within this challenge, we were tasked with conducting data analysis for a city's school district based on two csv file datasets. Utilizing Python and Pandas for dataset/dataframe manipulation and visualization allowed us to present cohesive information and actionable insights for the key decision makers of the district. Analysis includes visualizations with key metrics for a distric summary, a per school summary, both highest & lowest performing schools, math and reading scores by grade, scores categorized by school spending (per student), scores categorized by school size and scores categorized by school type (district vs. charter).

The file structure contains a "PyCitySchools" folder which includes a jupyter notebook file with code/outputs, a resources folder which contains the two csv data files and finally a "Module_4_Challenge_Written_Report_Pandas" .docx file for the written report portion.

Cheers!
