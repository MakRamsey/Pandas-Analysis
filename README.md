Greetings!


Welcome to the Pandas-Analysis repository. Within this project, we were tasked with conducting data analysis for a city's school district based on two csv file datasets. Utilizing Python and Pandas for dataset/dataframe manipulation and visualization allowed us to present cohesive information and actionable insights for the key decision makers of the district. Analysis includes visualizations with key metrics for a distric summary, a per school summary, both highest & lowest performing schools, math and reading scores by grade, scores categorized by school spending (per student), scores categorized by school size and scores categorized by school type (district vs. charter).


**Repository Stucture:**
